# Test work for AERO
To start this project, follow these instructions:
1) Download all files from the repository
2) In the project directory, open the console and enter **npm i** (download all modules)
3) After downloading the modules, enter the console **gulp watch**. After that, wait for the project to open the browser.

## General info
1) The project was completed in 9 hours
2) Used html5, css3, sass, js (nativ), gulp, stylelint (for readable scss), git
3) Works fine in chrome, opera, edge, firefox. I donâ€™t know about safari, since there is no way to check
4) Scripts are written on the standard ES6+
5) Layout is not adaptive and works with a strict width of 1280px. In case you need to expand, then replace in the SCSS, in the class container, the width is the min-width

## possible mistake
1) I have little experience, so I could do stupid things in REST API
